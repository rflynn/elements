3 Li Lithium
	"The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused 55% lithium chloride and 45% potassium chloride at about 450o C.[70] In 1998 it was about 95 US$ / kg (or 43 US$/pound)" -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium#Production

4 Be Beryllium
    The surface of beryllium metal is covered with a thin layer of oxide that helps protect the metal from attack by acids, but powdered beryllium metal dissolves readily in dilute acids such as sulphuric acid, H2SO4, hydrochloric acid, HCl, or nitric acid, HNO3, to form solutions containing the aquated Be(II) ion together with hydrogen gas, H2.
    Beryllium metal dissolves readily in dilute aquesous base solutions such as sodium hydroxide, NaOH, to form Be(II) complexes together with hydrogen gas, H2. Magnesium (immediately below beryllium in the periodic table) does not do this.

5 B Boron
	powder + mold + electric furnace -> sintered?
	"The operation is almost invariably carried out under a protective atmosphere, because of the large surface areas involved, and at temperatures between 60 and 90% of the melting-point of the particular metal or alloys."... http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1725
	
	http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Copper-Clay-Trilobites/?ALLSTEPS

	The first precious metal clays were introduced in the 1990's - made from pure silver powder and organic binders...
	The silver clay behaved kind of like a ceramic clay, could be molded, sculpted, carved, extruded etc.
	The metal clay was then 'fired' in a kiln or by torch, to produce a pure metal item.

	...Because it resists oxidation, fine silver can be fused by heat in an oxygen (normal atmosphere) environment such as in a kiln or open torch flame.
	When particles are heated, close to melting temperature, but not melting, they move close together and become sticky, adhereing to each other.
	This compaction and partial fusing is called 'sintering'.

	The basic recipe is organic binders, atomized metal (-325 mesh or smaller), glycerin and water.

	1/2 tsp. corn starch
	1/4 tsp. powdered xanthan gum (do not breathe in the powder!  It forms a VERY gummy slime when mixed with water)
	glycerin - a few drops adds a little flexibility
	3+  Tbsp atomized pure copper*
	distilled water in a small spray bottle.

	...

	http://www.metalclayacademy.com/

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintering
		In 1913, Weintraub and Rush patented a modified sintering method which combined electric current with pressure. The benefits of this method were proved for the sintering of refractory metals as well as conductive carbide or nitride powders. The starting boron–carbon or silicon–carbon powders were placed in an electrically insulating tube and compressed by two rods which also served as electrodes for the current. The estimated sintering temperature was 2000 °C.

12 Mg Magnesium
	sheet -> cut -> chemical etch

        Magnesium metal dissolves readily in dilute sulphuric acid to form solutions containing the aquated Mg(II) ion together with hydrogen gas, H2. Corresponding reactions with other acids such as hydrochloric acid also give the aquated Mg(II) ion.
        Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) → Mg2+(aq) + 2Cl-(aq) + H2(g)

        HCl clearly works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doZ9G9R3yfg
		nitric acid is mentioned in several places...
		Chemical etching was performed in a 1:50 solution of hydrochloric acid in deionized water and through a micropatterned photoresist mold. Commercial magnesium foils (70-μm-thick) were cleaned with solvent and citric acid to remove surface residues and oxides. Prior to photoresist patterning, one side of the magnesium foils was spin-coated with PDMS and mounted onto a glass substrate to confine etching to the opposite side and to serve as a substrate for the etched structures. Planar circular coils were fabricated by the chemical etching of magnesium foil through a photoresist mask (Microposit S1813 positive resist) featuring 50-μm-wide gaps and 250-μm-wide lines. Etched samples were immersed in acetone to remove the photoresist mask and released from the underlying substrate. -- http://www.mems.gatech.edu/msma/publications/2013/Methods%20for%20the%20microfabrication%20of%20magnesium.pdf

21 Sc Scandium

	World production of scandium is in the order of 2 tonnes per year in the form of scandium oxide. The primary production is 400 kg while the rest is from stockpiles of Russia generated during the Cold War. In 2003, only three mines produced scandium: the uranium and iron mines in Zhovti Vody in Ukraine, the rare earth mines in Bayan Obo, China and the apatite mines in the Kola peninsula, Russia. In each case, scandium is a byproduct from the extraction of other elements[11] and is sold as scandium oxide.

	The production of metallic scandium is in the order of 10 kg per year.[11][12] The oxide is converted to scandium fluoride and reduced with metallic calcium. -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandium

	Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture, at 700–800 °C, of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides.[21] The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960.

	HCl + H2O2
		http://developing-your-web-presence.blogspot.com/2008/10/on-titanium-thermite-bronze-age-and.html
		Chemical identification: for this you'll need strong hydrochloric acid (HCl 20 w% or more - 30 w% is better) and some pharmacy or hair dye grade hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, a few w%). Crush up some of the metal with a hammer (due to contamination with oxygen and nitrogen it's rather brittle) and put it in a test tube or otherwise suitable glass container and immerse it in the acid for 24 h or so. As small amounts of hydrogen sulphide (rotten eggs gas - see below) will be formed, store the assembly in a well ventilated place, away from your living quarters.
Although titanium is well known and desired for its excellent corrosion resistance, strong hydrochloric acid does attack it noticeably but slowly even at ambient temperatures, with the ubiquitous evolution of hydrogen gas. Titanium (III) chloride (TiCl3) is formed, which, depending on concentration has a beautiful, amethyst-like purple hue. After the overnight soak in HCl, carefully add a few drops of the hydrogen peroxide to the solution: a beautiful deep red, caused by a very characteristic red colour from a titanium (IV) peroxo complex being formed. A more detailed explanation can be found here.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium#Characteristics

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium
	"As an alternative for small-scale production, vanadium pentoxide is reduced with hydrogen or magnesium."
	Economically significant examples include patronite (VS4),[26] vanadinite (Pb5(VO4)3Cl), and carnotite (K2(UO2)2(VO4)2·3H2O). Much of the world's vanadium production is sourced from vanadium-bearing magnetite found in ultramafic gabbro bodies. Vanadium is mined mostly in South Africa, north-western China, and eastern Russia. In 2010 these three countries mined more than 98% of the 56,000 tonnes of produced vanadium.

    Manganese can purify not only mechanically removing the oxide from the surface, but also rinsing the metal in acid. Due to the fact that manganese is a very active metal, used for cleaning need only dilute acid (HCl, HNO 3 ). With the concentrated reaction proceeds so rapidly that the mixture begins to boil.

    germanium lens -> cut -> acid etch

    Because germanium is transparent in the infrared it is a very important infrared optical material, that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows... The material has a very high refractive index (4.0) and so needs to be anti-reflection coated. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental rough treatment.

		"Good Video. FYI: you can make a NON TOXIC silicone caulk mold, by using a caulking that releases ACETIC ACID (it will have a vinegar smell) on cure. (check the fine print on the label.) Get a bucket of HOT Water, mix in a bunch of SUNLIGHT BRAND DISH SOAP till its electric green/yellow, dunk your hand in and squeeze a golf ball size silicone ball into your hand. Keep your hand wet, and massage/knead thoroughly the silicone  for 1-2 min (This will wash the retardant out.) The silicone will appear translucent, and be semi clear when pressed on and applied. It will dry in under an hour. It will adhere to itself even after drying, so you can build up thickness if needed.)   No more Naptha, no more toxic fumes. Worst I ever got was dish pan hands. It isn't the greatest silicone mold material for detail, as it will leave flashing and lines and is NOT pourable, but at 3-5 bucks a tube it is again the cheaper alternative to Platinum cure silicones. Happy Moldmaking!"

		"I found that when making a mould you can use a 4 to 1 ratio of paint thinner to caulk (2 oz of caulk to 1/2 oz of paint thinner) to make a small mould using the bottom of a plastic cup. I added in about 3 drops (literally drops) of paint to the mix in order to help show the details of the mould. Once I had a consistent mix of paint thinner to caulk I added in about 1 tbs of corn starch as the hardening agent. This gave me about 5 to 10 minutes worth of pot time and fully set within 45 minutes."

		"Make sure that you don't apply it thicker than 1/8". This silicone cures when the acetic acid evaporates. If you layer it on too thick, the top layer will cure trapping a layer of uncured gooey silicone."
		"-Molds tear relatively easily (you could reinforce the silicone by adding a layer some burlap to the second layer while it is still tacky"
		"It would be important to specifiy what type of silicone to get, because not all are appropriate for use in making molds. It needs to be RTV (Vulcanizing) silicone. Many other silicones are air-dry - only the outside will dry, and the the inside will remain gooey, especially for thick molds."
		"I've had some really good results with this method. GREAT for making first draft parts. My advice for anyone who hasn't tried this is give the siliocone a few days to cure before trying to demold. Also, for larger pieces that don't require as much stretch, a layer of cheese cloth embedded into the silicone really adds strength. If you need a faster turn-around or for a longer lasting mold get some smooth-on. It's stronger easier to work with and doesn't stink."

Sulfuric acid can be produced in the laboratory by burning sulfur in air and dissolving the gas produced in a hydrogen peroxide solution.
	SO2 + H2O2 → H2SO4
