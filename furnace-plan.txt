hand-held MAPP torch

induction furnace
	spectacularly elegant, but they're complex, expensive and electricity hogs

arc furnace
	indirect or direct
	Moissan vs. steel-making
	very high temperatures achievable and quite efficient
	240v
	arc welder
	body
	optional -- vacuum

propane-powered foundry-style furnace
	research seems to suggest:
	bbq-style propane tank
		cheap, ubiquitous and propane burns surprisingly hot
	burner
		some people make their own, but i got mine from HarborFreight 
	furnace body
		cylindrical, taller than wide, hole in the side bottom for burner
		must be steel, not aluminium
		small hole at the bottom so spilled metal has somewhere to go -- smart!
		possibles:
			gallon paint can -- ~8"x6" is doable but seems too small to melt iron
			large piping
			small garbage can
			stock pot

			used drum -- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRcQqnoDgks
				14" high x ~14" wide
	furnace floor
		 "It is a really good idea to put something hard in the bottom of a forge, just to resist wear and tear. A hard brick or a kiln self from a ceramic supplier is good." -- http://bbs.homeshopmachinist.net/archive/index.php/t-51886.html
	insulation
		2" kaowool + refractory coating
		or >= 2" refractory cement
	refractory coating
		"Satanite and Mizzou are castable refractories. The ITC and Plistix are Infrared coatings used to retain more heat in the forge. Cover the wool with a refractory cement unless you want to develop silicosis or mesothelioma in 20 years. Then coat with the ITC and you will have good heat retention. Ive never used Plistix." -- http://www.iforgeiron.com/topic/24282-itc-100-vs-plistix-900f-vs-satanite-vs-mizzou/
		professional products are expensive -- $50-100
		ITC-100 -- http://www.hightemptools.com/itcproducts.html
		Plistix 900F -- http://www.zoellerforge.com/flare.html
		Fiberfrax QF-180 -- 
		zircon paint -- expensive, i think outrageously expensive now...
	furnace top
		small hole in the center to allow air out
		should be massive -- clay/cemnt/brick
	air blower
		$10 air mattress inflator -- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2wGV6g7I6E

	examples:
		http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DyeESQpac0 -- How to build a small cast iron melting furnace
			propane
			furnace body: 20L steel oil drum
			furnace floor: fireclay and Kaowool
			2" kaowool attached with sodium silicate
			zircon paint refractory
			melts 1.6 kgs of cast iron
			No 1 clay graphite crucible
